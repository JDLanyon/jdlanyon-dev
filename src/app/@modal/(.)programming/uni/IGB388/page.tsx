            <p>Several areas and models were created to give a clear indication to the locations of different supplies and to add to the shopping environment.</p>
            <p>A full layout was established over time and vaguely followed initial designs.</p>
            <p>Some notable bugs included texture clipping and issues with the player collider. Initially there were two colliders, one for the head and one for the player's body, which was then moved to the head colider with rotation lock and positioning the player according to the head position (VR headset position)</p>
            <p>As for the texture clipping, this was fixed by removing overlapping objects.</p>
