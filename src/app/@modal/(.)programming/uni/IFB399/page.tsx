            <p>There's not much to be said about this project as most of it was backend work and report writing, if you'd like to learn more feel free to <a href="https://github.com/JDLanyon/IFB399_BeeAware_Hive_Inspections" target="_blank" className="font-bold underline">view on GitHub</a></p>

            <p>A module/plugin was to be written for a beekeeping platform which handled the information tied to bee hives. There was a lot to be desired as despite working within a group of 4, I was the only one to submit a working product.</p>
            <p>The module was written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. SQL queries were made through the root project using C#.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>I'll write more on this one day I swear</p>
            <p>(I probably won't, being left alone on this assignment was awful lol)</p>
